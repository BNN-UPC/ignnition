    A subclass of the callback preset class which implements the functionality to keep only the best k checkpoints of the execution (instead of the best one implemented in Tf).

    Attributes
    ----------
    output_path:    str
        Path where the checkpoints are saved
    file_loss: dict
        Dictionary where we keep the loss of each of the checkpoints saved
    k: int

    Methods:
    ----------
    on_epoch_end(self, src_input, indices)
       At the end of each epoch, we check which of the checkpoints we need to delete (if any)
