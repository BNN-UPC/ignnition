# Contact and issues
*IGNNITION* has been released as an open-source project powered by Barcelona Neural Networking Center [BNN](https://bnn.upc.edu), making it our goal to build a community around *IGNNITION*, all working with our common goal of encouraging scientific and commercial break-throughs though the use of Graph Neural Networks.

Consequently, we welcome any kind of feed-back that can help us make this tool more useful to the community and to all its potential users. For this reason, we invite you to contact us at ***contactus@ignnition.net***.

To report any issue regarding *IGNITTION* as well as to suggest the addition of new features, please refer to [issues](https://github.com/knowledgedefinednetworking/ignnition/issues).
