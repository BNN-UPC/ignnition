        "[PewDiePie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw) is a Swedish YouTuber and has 100 million subscribers on YouTube (He is my favorite). He gains thousands of subscribers every day, so I thought of writing a tutorial about his gain in subscribers. So I wanted to show you guys a practical implementation of Machine Learning's Linear Regression Algorithm. Here we can apply linear regression to predict his daily YouTube subscribers. I will guide you guys throughout this tutorial how to do so. I will not explain the theory behind linear regression algorithms, because according to me the theory is not so important only the implementation is very important, because you need to know how and where to apply the algorithm. However, I will encourage you to go through some theory online, one of the best articles is shown below:"
