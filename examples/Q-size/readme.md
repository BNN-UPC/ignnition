# Executing Q-Size example

For this example, the data is unfortunately not publicly available. Nevertheless, we provide the full set of required files to execute this model, which should be helful to get a general idea of the inner working of this model.

We have also included the *global_variables* file, even though right now is not used by the *model_description* file. To learn to use them, we refer the user to (https://ignnition.net/doc/global_variables/).
