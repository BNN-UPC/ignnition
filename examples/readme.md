# Execution of the provided examples
In this directory we have included a set of implementations of some of the most relevant proposals of *GNNs* applied to the field of Comunication Networks.

Notice that this library, however, is under continuous development, and thus we greatly appreciate suggestions or even contributions to help us grow this library of examples even more. Of course any contribution will be consequently noted in the contributors file. To contact us, please visit (https://ignnition.net/).

One important aspect of this library is that we do our best to allow users to easily execute any of these examples. We believe this fact considerably helps to understand the inner working of *IGNNITION*, and thus, helps users create new custom models. For this, the directory of each of the examples contains further information on how each of them should be executed.
