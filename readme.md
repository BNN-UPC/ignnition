Recent years have witnessed the vast potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to be applied to a plethora of problems where data is structured as graphs (e.g., computer networks, chemistry, physics). Typically, each new application requires custom GNN models adapted to the problem environment. In this context, implementing a GNN model is a cumbersome task that currently requires Machine Learning (ML) experts with high skills in neural network programming. For instance, to translate the model to complex tensor-wise operations in languages such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. We claim that, in order to approach GNNs to real-world applications it is essential to count on tools that abstract users from the complexity behind the implementation of such models. This repository presents IGNNITION, a novel framework to fast prototype complex GNN models. IGNNITION targets users with little to no background on neural network programming, while still providing great flexibility to implement a broad variety of GNN architectures. This framework enables to define a GNN model as an intuitive human-readable description of the objects present in graphs and the type of relations they may have, and it automatically generates an efficient TensorFlow implementation of the model. In order to assist users, it provides advanced debugging mechanisms to easily identify and correct possible errors in GNN models. Moreover, GNN models generated by our framework do not incur performance loss compared to native implementations in TensorFlow.

## Quick Start
### Requirements
First of all, you can prepare the Python environment for the demo executing the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command installs all the dependencies needed to execute IGNNITION.

### Reproducing an example
In order to start using IGNITTION, we provide two use-cases so that the user can start familiarizing himself with the workflow of this framework. The first use-case is RouteNet and the second is a much more complicated Message Passing model which uses additionaly the queue size information. Both these examples can be found in ['examples' directory](examples), each in its respective directory. Let us now breafly describe the content of these two use-cases:

#### Model_description
We provide the model_description.json file to generate the model.

### Dataset
A dataset.json file is incorporated, however this is just a subset of the real datatset. For this reason the user should follow several steps to produce the complete one for the Routenet use-case.

In order to obtain the full datasets to properly replicate these experiments, it is first necessary to download some datasets from the [repository](https://github.com/knowledgedefinednetworking/NetworkModelingDatasets/tree/master/datasets_v0). In it you can find three datasets with samples simulated with a custom packed-level simulator in three different topologies: NSFNET(2GB), GEANT(6GB) and synthetic 50 nodes (28.7 GB) topologies. To download an decompress any of the three datasets you can use the followin commands:
```
wget "http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/datasets_v0/nsfnet.tar.gz"
wget "http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/datasets_v0/geant2.tar.gz"
wget "http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/datasets_v0/synth50.tar.gz"
tar -xvzf nsfnet.tar.gz 
tar -xvzf geant2.tar.gz 
tar -xvzf synth50.tar.gz
```

Once any of them has been downloaded, we provide a script called migration.py in the same directory which is the one that will automatically migrate the raw dataset into the json format required by the framework. This files can be found be executed as follows:
```
python3 migrate.py --dataset <dataset_path> --output_path <output_path>
```

#### Main.py
In the directory, the main.py file is also provided. It is IMPORTANT to note that the content of this file should be copied to the actual main.py of the framework, which can be found in ['code' directory](code).

#### Set the paths
At this point, the user must indicate the framework the paths for all these previously mentioned files. For this, modify the train_options.ini file in ['code' directory](code) with the paths of the specific example (training dataset, evaluation dataset, model_description file,...) as well as several custom options regarding the evaluation of the model and how the model should be saved.

#### Execute the framework
Finally, execute the framework by placing the scope in the ['code' directory](code) and executing the following command line
```
python3 main.py
```

With this, a debug_model directory should be generated as well as the trained model.


## 'How to' guide

Design and train your own GNN model in three simple steps:

### Step 1: Design the GNN model's architecture
The first step is to define the model's architecture. This is done by creating a model_description.json file where the several sections of the model's design should be specified. The two examples provided contain its corresponding file, which should be a good starting point as most likely only a few modifications of the files are required. Furthermore, an additional file "keywords_cheat_sheet.pdf" is provided. This file contains the description of all the possible keywords, as well as some useful information to guide the user to efficiently create a new model. The user must define all the fields marked with (*) in the table, and follow the constraints defined within this document, specifing what the required fields are, and how they should be filled. .

###  Step 2: Migrate your dataset
The second step is to migrate the original datset that is intended to be used to JSON format, containing the key words used in the model description file. In escence, a valid dataset contains (at least one) compressed file (format .tar.gz) with a data.json file within with the data samples. Again, the migration.py files corresponding to the use-case of routenet should be good starting point, as to fully understand the final structure that any dataset should have to be a valid input to IGNNITION.

###  Step 3: Execute the model training/evaluation
Once these has been done, we must fill appropriately the main.py file. In this file we must create the model and indicate the functionality that we want to use, which can be:

1) Create the model
```
model = ignnition.create_model()
```
2) Train and evaluate
```
ignnition.train_and_evaluate(model)
```

3) Generate debug model
```
ignnition.debug(model)
```
4) Make predictions
```
ignnition.predict(model)
```

Furthermore, both the normalization and denormalization functions should be defined in case the model_description.json uses any. In this case, it is important that the names used in the model_description.json match with the name of the function in the main.py.

### Indicating the paths
Note that it is necessay to indicate the paths to the input files of the framework. Thus, the user should modify the train_options.ini found in ['code' directory](code) with its corresponding paths and the appropriate training options to be used.

### Generating the model
At this point, we are in position of running the framework, for which the user must use the following command line:

```
python3 main.py
```

### Visualization of the debug model

In case the user chose to generate the debug model of the model description indicated, a new directory debug_model will be created ['code' directory] which contains the event files that can be visualized using the Tensorboard tool. For this, type the following command line:
```
tensorboard --logdir <path_to_debug_model_dir>
```

Then, you can connect in a web browser to 'http://localhost:6006/' and see a graphical representation of the model's architecture.
